I'm sure you know what this is...

It works, but it's not quite done yet, so don't complain if something goes wrong if you choose to install it

1.) You're going to need the latest [zEdit](https://github.com/z-edit/zedit) release
2.) Go to the release section, download the latest patcher, and extract
3.) Move the folder into the zEdit\modules folder
